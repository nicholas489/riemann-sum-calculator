# Riemann Sum Calculator

This Python script simplifies the process of calculating the area under any given function over a specified interval using Riemann Sums. It supports various approximation methods, including the Trapezoid, Left, Middle, and Right Rectangular approximations.

## Features
- Supports basic parent functions (e.g., square/cube roots, trigonometric functions, absolute value, exponential functions).
- Allows for custom polynomial functions.
- Offers four approximation methods: Left, Middle, Right, and Trapezoid.
- Outputs the approximate integral value to a file.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Input your function when prompted (e.g., `sin(x)`, `x**2 + 3`, etc.).
3. Choose your approximation method (`Left`, `Middle`, `Right`, `Trapezoid`).
4. Enter the lower and upper bounds of integration.
5. Specify the number of subintervals to use for the approximation.
6. Check `output.txt` for the result.
